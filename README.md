Impact of User Stories
	
	The home service business owners we talked to all agreed that there wasn’t a great way to build connections with other home services pros in their area. Every business owner knows that who you know is critical in getting work, so WorkTogether was created to facilitate that. We wanted the app to be a community used by business owners & not by clients- C-to-B services are plentiful, and creating another one wouldn’t solve our users’ problems. By creating a B-to-B solution, businesses are able to build connections between one another while simultaneously solving their customers’ problems!
	
	We chose a pretty simple layout for the app. We didn’t want to become Instagram, as businesses often stay connected there as-is. We did provide some functionality for businesses to share their work for others to see, but wanted to include lots of information about the referrals businesses were passing between one another. We provided information on how many referrals businesses passed & how many they received, as well as the percentage of those referrals that “converted”, or where the client actually went forward with the referred vendor. We tried to focus on the Business-to-Business experience as well as we could!
