# Work-Together-App
This app wasa CS 356 class assignment to produce a functional prototype app that adapted to user experiences and stories. 

Work Together solves the problem of small business owners or contractors need a way to refer clients to other businesses when they request another job they need performed


# Research:

## Skeletons
**Skeleton A (Small Business owner):**
- Manages 1-3 employees
- Wishes to be well connected and to meet every clients needs
- Doesn’t meet other business services on a regular basis

**Skeleton B (Client of a Small Business):**
- Looking for reputable businesses 
- Trusts one service provider & wants to know who they recommend for another need they have

**Skeleton C(The Referred Small Business):**
- Needs/wants a way to easily receive/send/manage referrals

## User Stories

## Persona
Name: John Price
Age: 52
Job: Carpenter
Brief Bio:  John runs a small carpentry business. He gets a lot of good work, but often finds there are some tasks that he cannot perform for his clients because it is not within his specialization. He has been thinking of expanding his expertise to make some extra money performing more jobs, but doesn’t necessarily have the time or desire to really do it. He wishes there was a way that he could have those jobs performed, maybe by another person, but that he gets compensated for finding the client.

Goals: 
Provide clean and reliable service
Expand his profession by connecting to other local businesses
Spend quality time with his kids and wife
Learn new techniques for his trade 
Winning the Kansas state fishing tournament
Frustrations:
Not knowing a clear cut answer for his clients
That one pot hole to his office


# prototype stage 1: 

Changes that we'll make
- Top part of each business’ profile looks cluttered
- Add a search menu option on the bottom for faster access
- Improve the “popular searches” page

Changes we will ignore
- Took some scrolling to get to the bottom bar- that’s a prototype-only problem & will be resolved in a production app

# Impact of User Stories
	
The home service business owners we talked to all agreed that there wasn’t a great way to build connections with other home services pros in their area. Every business owner knows that who you know is critical in getting work, so WorkTogether was created to facilitate that. We wanted the app to be a community used by business owners & not by clients- C-to-B services are plentiful, and creating another one wouldn’t solve our users’ problems. By creating a B-to-B solution, businesses are able to build connections between one another while simultaneously solving their customers’ problems!
	
We chose a pretty simple layout for the app. We didn’t want to become Instagram, as businesses often stay connected there as-is. We did provide some functionality for businesses to share their work for others to see, but wanted to include lots of information about the referrals businesses were passing between one another. We provided information on how many referrals businesses passed & how many they received, as well as the percentage of those referrals that “converted”, or where the client actually went forward with the referred vendor. We tried to focus on the Business-to-Business experience as well as we could!
